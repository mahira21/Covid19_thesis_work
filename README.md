# Covid19_thesis_work
An iterative strategy has been used during the training and evaluation phase of the study. This study has used three machine-learning algorithms: Logistic regression, neural network keras ,XGBoost
## Motivation 
- Symptoms can not be detected immediately after being affected
- Even symptoms are getting blurred day by day
- If a person can be warned before it is too late, they can take prevention measures
## Research Questions
- Can we conduct a study to find the relevancy of lifestyle and hygiene-related guidelines?
- How will a machine learning approach to analyzing lifestyles help us to accomplish our goals?
- Can our approach be a finalizer in predicting a person's risk factor of getting affected?
- Can we identify the habits that are most important in defying the risk factor of getting affected?
